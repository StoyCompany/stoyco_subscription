# The following section is specific to Flutter packages.
flutter:
  # To add assets to your package, add an assets section, like this:
  assets:
    - lib/assets/icons/subscription_icon.svg
  #
  # For details regarding assets in packages, see
  # https://flutter.dev/to/asset-from-package
  #
  # An image asset can refer to one or more resolution-specific "variants", see
  # https://flutter.dev/to/resolution-aware-images

  # To add custom fonts to your package, add a fonts section here,
  # in this "flutter" section. Each entry in this list should have a
  # "family" key with the font family name, and a "fonts" key with a
  # list giving the asset and other descriptors for the font. For
  # example:
  fonts:
    - family: Akkurat_Pro
      fonts:
        - asset: lib/assets/fonts/Akkurat_Pro/AkkBd_Pro_1.otf
        - asset: lib/assets/fonts/Akkurat_Pro/AkkRg_Pro_1.otf
    - family: GT_Pressura_Mono
      fonts:
        - asset: lib/assets/fonts/GT_Pressura_Mono/gt-pressura-mono-regular.ttf
        - asset: lib/assets/fonts/GT_Pressura_Mono/gt-pressura-mono-regular-italic.ttf
        - asset: lib/assets/fonts/GT_Pressura_Mono/gt-pressura-mono-light.ttf
        - asset: lib/assets/fonts/GT_Pressura_Mono/gt-pressura-mono-light-italic.ttf
        - asset: lib/assets/fonts/GT_Pressura_Mono/gt-pressura-mono-bold.ttf
